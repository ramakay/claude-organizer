## The Messy File Problem üóÇÔ∏è

Claude Code creates files everywhere. Despite CLAUDE.md instructions saying "don't create scripts in the root directory," it keeps creating test files, debug scripts, and documentation right at your project root:

```
my-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test-api-v1.md               # First attempt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test-api-v2.md               # "Fixed" version
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test-api-final.md            # "Final" version
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test-api-final-FIXED.md      # Actually final?
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ debug-webhook.mjs            # Quick test script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ analyze-performance.mjs      # Debugging session
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (87 more files at root!)
```

**Solution**: Automatic file organization using AI-powered categorization

## How Claude Organize Helps

### üóÇÔ∏è Automatic File Organization

```
my-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/                         # Source code stays untouched
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ testing/                 # Test results organized
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ troubleshooting/         # Debug notes in one place
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ checks/                  # Validation scripts grouped
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ debug/                   # Debug utilities together
```

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npm install -g claude-organize
```

### Setup File Organization

You have two options to configure the file organization hook:

#### Option 1: Using Claude's /hooks command (Recommended)

Use Claude Code's built-in /hooks command to configure:

```bash
# Step 1: Type the /hooks command
/hooks

# Step 2: Select "PostToolUse" from the menu

# Step 3: Enter the matcher pattern:
Write|Edit|MultiEdit

# Step 4: Select "command" as the hook type

# Step 5: Enter the command:
claude-organize

# Step 6: Press Enter to confirm

# Step 7: Press Esc twice to exit the menu

# That's it! The hook is now configured
```

#### Option 2: Manual Configuration

Add to your `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit|MultiEdit",
        "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "claude-organize" }]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## How This Complements Claude Code Best Practices

According to [Claude Code Best Practices](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices), the recommended approaches include:

- **Hierarchical CLAUDE.md files** - Great for static organization in monorepos
- **Shorter sessions with /clear** - Helps manage context effectively
- **Using subagents** - Reduces context usage for complex tasks

**Claude Organize complements these practices:**

**File Organization (Hooks)** - Works regardless of session length. Even with `/clear` and perfect CLAUDE.md setup, Claude still creates files in root. Our hooks ensure consistent organization.

Think of it this way:

- **Best Practices**: Organize your kitchen (hierarchical CLAUDE.md)
- **Claude Organize**: Clean as you cook (hooks)

Both approaches work together for optimal Claude Code workflows.

## Key Features

‚úÖ **Automatic cleanup** - Files move to proper directories instantly  
‚úÖ **AI categorization** - Understands file purpose from content  
‚úÖ **10 script subcategories** - Detailed organization for scripts  
‚úÖ **Safe defaults** - Protects README, LICENSE, configs  
‚úÖ **Context reduction** - Cleaner workspace = better Claude performance

## Categories

Files are automatically organized into these directories:

### Documentation

- `docs/testing/` - Test results, QA reports
- `docs/analysis/` - Data analysis, performance reports
- `docs/architecture/` - System design, technical docs
- `docs/operations/` - Deployment guides, runbooks
- `docs/troubleshooting/` - Debug logs, issue investigations

### Scripts

- `scripts/checks/` - Verification and validation utilities
- `scripts/testing/` - Test scripts and runners
- `scripts/deployment/` - Deployment and release scripts
- `scripts/utilities/` - General utility scripts
- [+ 6 more subcategories](docs/subcategories.md)

## Common Scenarios

### The "Create and Run" Learning Curve

![Learning Curve](docs/assets/images/learning-curve.jpeg)

You might encounter this scenario:

```
Claude: "I'll create test-email.mjs and run it"
*Creates file*
*File gets organized to scripts/testing/*
Claude: "Error: Cannot find module './test-email.mjs'"
```

**This is intentional!** The friction teaches Claude (and us) better habits:

1. **First time**: Claude learns files don't stay at root
2. **Second time**: Claude checks where files went (`find . -name "test-email.mjs"`)
3. **Third time**: Claude runs directly from organized location

Just like training a junior developer: "Test files go in the test directory."

### Why This Matters

The housekeeper doesn't compromise on cleanliness. This "friction" is actually a feature:

- Claude learns project structure through experience
- Better long-term habits > short-term convenience
- Consistent organization > temporary files at root

## Slash Commands

- `/claude-organize-bypass` - Toggle file organization on/off
- `/claude-organize-add <pattern>` - Add patterns to be organized
- `/claude-organize-js` - Enable JavaScript organization (experimental)

## Safety & Disclaimers

**‚ö†Ô∏è USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**: Claude Organize moves files in your project. Always use version control and test in a safe environment first.

- ‚úÖ **Use version control** (Git) before enabling
- ‚úÖ **Test in a safe environment** first
- ‚úÖ **Review the organization log** at `docs/organization-log.json`
